Brain Tumor Detector (MATLAB)
Overview
This project implements a Brain Tumor Detection system using MATLAB. The system analyses MRI brain images through image processing techniques and presents the results using an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).
Features
•	GUI-based system with four-panel visualization
•	MRI image loading and preprocessing
•	Binary thresholding and segmentation
•	Noise removal and region cleanup
•	Final tumor visualization using thermal view
Dataset Structure

 └── no    (MRI images without tumor)
How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Set the project folder as the Current Folder
3. Run the file: TumorDetectionGUI_4Panel
4. Use GUI buttons to load and analyze MRI images
