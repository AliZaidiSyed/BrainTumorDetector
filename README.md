# Brain Tumor Detection (MATLAB)

## Overview
A MATLAB-based Brain Tumor Detection system that analyses MRI brain images using image processing techniques and displays results through a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- GUI with 4-panel display (Original MRI, Binary Threshold, Cleaned Segments, Final Detection)
- MRI image loading and preprocessing
- Threshold-based segmentation
- Noise removal and tumour area detection
- Thermal visualisation for detected tumours

## Dataset Structure
brain_tumor_dataset/
├── yes/ (MRI images with tumour)
└── no/ (MRI images without tumour)
